def nth_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, N: int) -> pd.DataFrame:

    #Removing duplicates is a crucial step in this problem to ensure accurate results, as you rightly pointed out in your updated procedure. It ensures that the Nth highest salary is correctly identified even when multiple employees have the same salary.
    # Drop any duplicate salary values to avoid counting duplicates as separate salary ranks
    unique_salaries = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates() #unique_salaries is not a DataFrame, it's a Series

    # Sort the unique salaries in descending order and get the Nth highest salary
    sorted_salaries = unique_salaries.sort_values(ascending=False)

    #The line if N > len(sorted_salaries): is checking if the value of N (the rank of the salary you're interested in) is greater than the total number of unique salaries in the list. If N is larger, it means there isn't an Nth highest salary, because N is beyond the range of the data.
    # If N exceeds the number of unique salaries, return None
    if N > len(sorted_salaries):
        return pd.DataFrame({f'getNthHighestSalary({N})': [None]})
    
    #The sorted_salaries is a Series of unique salaries sorted in descending order.
    #sorted_salaries.iloc[N - 1] is using the iloc indexer to select the Nth highest salary from the sorted list. The iloc indexer is used to index by integer-location based indexing, meaning it's looking at the numerical index position of the data.
    #Since Python uses 0-based indexing, you need to subtract 1 from N to get the correct index. So N - 1 gives the correct index for the Nth highest salary.
    # Get the Nth highest salary from the sorted salaries
    nth_highest = sorted_salaries.iloc[N - 1]
    
    return pd.DataFrame({f'getNthHighestSalary({N})': [nth_highest]})

# In the code, f'getNthHighestSalary({N})' is using an f-string to create a string that includes the value of N. The resulting string will be something like 'getNthHighestSalary(2)' if N is 2.

# This f-string is used as a key in the dictionary that is passed to pd.DataFrame to name the column in the resulting DataFrame. It's a dynamic way to set the column name based on the value of N.
