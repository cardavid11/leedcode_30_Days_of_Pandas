    # of each word in a string. However, it's not suitable for this case 
    # as we only want to capitalize the first letter of the string, not each word.
    # Example: 'mary ann' with str.title() becomes 'Mary Ann' but with str.capitalize() becomes 'Mary ann'.

    # instead of creating an intermediate variable.
